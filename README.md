# PhyloReplica
Learning Invariant correlation across phylogenic tree. Ongoing...


## src
 PhyloDataset.py: Define the datastructure along the phylogenic tree
 
 PhyloTrees.py: Define the tree of models and the coupled learning scheme
 
 GProT.py: simple GPT for proteins, to be inserted in the nodes.
 
 vae.py:  simple GPT for proteins, to be inserted in the nodes.
 
 ## TO DO:
 Compute directly the tree
 
 Test on a supervised Learning task -> see with Martin
